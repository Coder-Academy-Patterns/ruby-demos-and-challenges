# Ruby Demos (for teachers) and Challenges (for students)

## Demos

Teachers, use the demos in class to teach new concepts. Each section has a list of skills covered, which you can share with the students by say writing on the whiteboard, has its own step-by-step explanation, and a list of challenges that progress from an easy to hard level.

As many challenge solutions are present, donâ€™t share this repo with students.

## Challenges

Give the challenge briefs to the students.
