1. Modeling the nouns of your app
2. Separating classes into their own files
3. Which code goes where? Is signing up an account part of Service, Account, or even someplace else?
4. When we get to Rails, this will be more prescribed. However, in pure Ruby there are less standards to follow.


1. Menus
    - Displaying a menu
    - Getting the user’s choice
    - What happens if the user enters something wrong?
2. Loops
    - Run code again and again until the user makes the right choice
3. Validation
    - Code that checks if the user’s choice is valid
4. Separating model from the user facing code
    - No `puts`/`gets` inside model
    - Dedicate files for menus / UI code
